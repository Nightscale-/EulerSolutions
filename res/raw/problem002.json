  "example": "For example, consider a max value of 9. The Fibonnaci numbers less than 9 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Summing the even numbers, we get 8 + 2 = 10.",

    "We can prove that starting at the second number, ever third term afterwards is even. Then we use Binet's formula for finding the nth Fibonnaci value and sum the values.",
